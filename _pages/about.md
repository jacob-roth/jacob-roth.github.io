### Background
I studied economics in undergrad, worked for two years as an investment analyst, and returned to school to study statistics as an MS student.
My coursework focused on optimization, numerical analysis, and computational statistics.
During this time, I worked on problems in medical imaging (CT reconstruction) with [Professor Emil Sidky](http://home.uchicago.edu/~sidky/) and robust optimization with [Professor Mihai Anitescu](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/).
Currently, I'm a working in Professor Anitescu's group at Argonne National Laboratory on rare event simulation for power networks through a yearlong [appointment](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jacob-michael-roth).

### Research Interests
My current research interests include stochastic and robust optimization, (stochastic) dynamical systems, and Bayesian inference.
