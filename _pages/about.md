### Background
Currently, I'm a working in [Professor Mihai Anitescu](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/) group at Argonne National Laboratory studying rare events in power networks through a yearlong [appointment](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jacob-michael-roth).
Prior to this, I studied economics in undergrad, worked for two years as an investment analyst, and returned to school to study statistics in an MS program.
My coursework focused on optimization, numerical analysis, and computational statistics.
During this time, I worked on problems in medical imaging with [Professor Emil Sidky](http://home.uchicago.edu/~sidky/) and robust optimization with Professor Anitescu.

### Research Interests
My current research interests include stochastic and robust optimization, (stochastic) dynamical systems, and Bayesian inference.
