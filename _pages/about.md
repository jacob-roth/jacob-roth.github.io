### Background
I studied economics in undergrad, worked for two years as an investment analyst, and returned to school to study statistics as an MS student.
My coursework focused on optimization, numerical analysis, and computational statistics, and during this time, I worked on problems in medical imaging (CT reconstruction) and robust optimization.

### Research Interests
My current research interests include random dynamical systems, stochastic and robust optimization, and Bayesian inference.
