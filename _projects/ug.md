### Overview
For my bachelor's paper, I worked with Professor Henry Schellhorn on numerically approximating a PDE from the financial literature applicable to option pricing.
Before getting to the PDE, I studied its origins origins and derivation through the theory of indifference pricing for contingent claims.
I enjoyed learning about indifference pricing since it combined principles from economic decisionmaking with mathematical tools I wasn't familar with.
And almost all of the mathematical tools were new to me.
In particular, the PDE we considered was came from a stochastic volatility SDE, and it was my first exposure to
 1. PDE
 2. SDE
 3. the close relationship between SDE and PDE through Fokker-Planck-type equations (though I didn't understand this at the time)
 4. numerical analysis & methods.
In the project, we considered simple deterministic and sampling-based numerical methods for approximating the PDE and in turn compared the results.
