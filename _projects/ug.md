### Overview
During my senior year of undergrad, I worked with [Professor Henry Schellhorn](https://scholar.cgu.edu/henry-schellhorn/) on numerically approximating a PDE from the financial literature.
The PDE was derived using the theory of [indifference pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_price) for contingent claims.
This theory sits at the intersection of economics and mathematics and formulates the hedging problem through the lens of "utility" within a stochastic optimization framework.
In our case, the PDE we considered came from an SDE model for an asset price involving stochastic volatility.
The close relationship between PDE and SDE (through Fokker-Planck-type equations) allowed us to apply simple deterministic and sampling-based numerical methods for approximately pricing the security.
