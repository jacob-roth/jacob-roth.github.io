In this [talk](https://galton.uchicago.edu/students/seminars/2017-2018/roth_jacob053118.pdf), we provide an overview of decisionmaking under uncertainty within a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) framework.
The DRCC framework sits between two well-known optimization paradigms: (1) robust optimization (RO) and (2) stochastic optimization (SO).
We use a third framework, (3) data-driven optimization (and two numerical studies), to bridge RO and SO and contextualize a computationally tractable form of the DRCC model.
