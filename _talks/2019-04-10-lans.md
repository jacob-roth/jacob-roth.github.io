In this [talk](https://www.anl.gov/event/cascading-failures-and-energy-landscapes-for-power-systems), we introduce a first-principles, stochastic model for power system dynamics and discuss its application to studying cascading electrical grid failure.
We interpret the time-evolution of the dynamics model as the diffusion of a particle in an energy landscape subject to stochastic forcing and discuss large deviation arguments which can be used to relate “reaction rates” (the rate of individual line failure) to the underlying energy surface.
Preliminary validation results are presented, and future applications, including probabilistic cascading failure models and transmission system planning, are discussed.

<!-- , and the theory provides a way of expressing the line failure rate analytically. A thermodynamics setting like this exposes relationships which may differ from traditional thinking (see Fig. 1) but introduces others (see Fig. 2) that can be adopted for practical purposes. For example, individual line failure times can be modeled by exponential random variables parametrized by the analytic failure rates.

Given individual line failure rates, sequences of line failures can be constructed by unifying the individual models within a kinetic Monte Carlo framework, one commonly used in molecular dynamics. In essence, failure events in the dynamic model can be translated into a graphical Markov model where vertices represent network “states” and directed edges represent transition rates between states. Cascade generation then amounts to (appropriately time-stamped) tree-traversal, and approximations of risk or cost quantities can be computed via simulation.

As an alternative to the simulation-based Markov model, we also propose to develop a fully analytic probability model based on the locally parametrized line failure models. The explicit random variable structure in the above Markov model admits a “piecewise” approximation to the probability of observing particular sequence of failures occurring within specified time increments. This incremental approach offers a rather limited view of the “probability of cascading failure”, though, and further investigation is proposed to develop a more applicable and interpretable model. One such approach might be to construct a surrogate function for cascading probabilities and metrics of interest. In turn this would ideally yield differentiable representations of the probability of shedding a certain amount of load in a given time frame, an essential metric for assessing the cascade risk of a given configuration.

 and study its invariant measure through an appropriate energy landscape. We present preliminary validation results for line failure-rate approximations and hint at their future applicability.
