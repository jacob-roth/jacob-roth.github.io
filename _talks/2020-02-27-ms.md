Following its introduction in the 1950s, the conjugate gradient (CG) method was viewed as a direct method for solving linear systems.
A decade or so later, extensions were developed for interpreting it as an iterative procedure for solving more general nonlinear systems, including function minimization.
CG is a foundational procedure in numerical linear algebra, but given the decade-long gap between the linear and nonlinear interpretations, its derivation may be murky without appropriate context.
In this [talk](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/content/environmental-data-science-lunch-2020-presentations#jake-roth), we will review and motivate the method from a geometric perspective and demonstrate an example of its applicability to an environmental problem.
